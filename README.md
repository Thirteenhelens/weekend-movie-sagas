# Movie Picker

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Sprint_

This app is used to keep track of movies! Either movies you have watched, or ones you want to. 
Selecting a movie on the initial page will bring you to a new page that contains more information on the chosen movie, including genres, and a description. You may also add new movies on a separate page.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Code editor of choice. (Built using VS Code)
- A browser installed.

## Installation

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Look through each of the movies.
2. If a movie intrigues you, click learn more to find out more!
3. When you are done looking at the details of your chosen movie, click `Back to List`.
4. If you would like to add a new movie, click `Add new movie`.
5. Fill out the form to add a movie. When done, click `Add Movie`.
6. Otherwise, click `Cancel` to be brought back to the home page with the list of movies.
